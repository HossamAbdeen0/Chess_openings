# Chess_openings
This project utilizes a dataset from https://mavenanalytics.io/ titled "Online Chess Games."
The goal is to conduct exploratory data analysis and develop a predictive model to forecast chess game outcomes based on player ratings and opening moves. While chess is notoriously difficult to predict, such a model could be valuable for tournament preparation, helping players select optimal openings against various opponents—both as White and Black—potentially increasing their chances of winning, even slightly so.

This project should dominstrate my abitity to:

1. Comprehend the task and approach it analytically
2. Understand and prepare the data
3. Model using logistic regression
